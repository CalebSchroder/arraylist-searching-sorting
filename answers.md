SEARCH QUESTIONS

1. The binary algoritm does not need to check as many indexes within my group of jellybeans. While the regular search can check as many as all of the indexes.

2. The less places an algorithm has to check or essentially loop through, the more efficent it is. Binary search is more efficent because it does not check as many indexes in the array.

3. 
 i. Search would start at apple checking each fruit until it goes through the entire list and finds nothing, then returning -1. Binary search would start at lime, the check banana, then either cherry or lemon and say it is not there.
 
 ii.Search = 11, Binary Search = 3

 iii.Search = 1000, Binary Search = ~9
4.

 SORT QUESTIONS

 1. They all have their advantages and disadvantages. Under certain situations bubble and insertion are way less efficent but sometimes they are way better. The benefits of the algorithms seems to be situation dependant.

 2. 
 	i. Selection = 100, Insertion = 55, Bubble  = 5

 	ii. Selection = 100, Insertion = 10, Bubble = 100

 	iii. Selection = 100; Insertion = ~27, Bubble = ~50

 3. It could be reasonable because binary search is way more efficent and would be a lot better for extremely large lists.
